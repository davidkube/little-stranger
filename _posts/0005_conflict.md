the first version of this post was so boring. i even used work as an example. im so tired of work getting involved with every facet of my life

anyway, lets make it saucy.

freedom and community. there. it took 500 words to get to that part originally.

they are in conflict with each other. you cant pursue freedom without neglecting your community. you cant build a community by focusing on your freedom.

thats the thesis.

can you live your life without either? idk hey, sounds lonely/suffocating

the human experience is a long list of oxymoronic needs which can never be truly fulfilled because they are inherently in (wait for it) conflict with one another.

i guess stop trying is the message.

or at least try harder, differently.

i lied about the sauce.
