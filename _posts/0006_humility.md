it's interesting

i originally planned on writing this blog post in early april. there was a big dramatic moment happening in my life at the time (a trend with my blog posts)

nearly 3 months later, what am I writing about?

my idea of humility has changed so many times since i first started this post.

death, where is your sting? this has nothing to do with my original idea

humilty is a superpower? this has nothing to do with death having a sting

sit down, be humble. the first lesson i learned, 7 years ago now

humility wont help you overcome death. 

but it will help you see death for what it is

a scared child, trying to figure out why they have to take care of all these lost souls
