ive had this opinion for a while that whenever i get asked a question that seemingly has no answer then the question itself must be wrong. its an easy cop-out for making difficult decisions

who is to blame for the war in gaza? nope, cant answer. the question is wrong

how do you celebrate a goal scored by a rapist? your premise is wrong, i dont need to answer that.

who are you? and what do you want?

its a bit harder to ignore that one.

iroh called these the big__questions. sometimes it feels like theyre the only ones that really do matter. other days im stuck wondering if we ever get a chance to answer them

this post has been waiting to be written since i spun up this blog a few months ago. when i was starting something new and felt like all i had left was answering these questions

i expected to write this post and have a profound answer. im tired of looking for answers. im also tired of running from them

but maybe these arent questions, maybe theyre the answer

what are your big__questions?
